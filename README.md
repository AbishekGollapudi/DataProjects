# Project Portfolio
______________

The following projects were developed as part of a 12-week immersive data science program, Metis. 

## [AirBnB Pricing Recommender](https://github.com/AbishekGollapudi/DataProjects/tree/master/AirBnB%20Pricing)
**Using machine learning to identify optimal prices**

Used AirBnB data from InsideAirBnB to identify key characteristics that improve a listing's marketability in Tokyo, Japan. In addition, performed feature engineering to handle amenities and exploratory data analysis to understand how geographic locations played a role in listing popularity. Compared performance and interpretability from various regression models such as linear regression, lasso, ridge, and XGBoost to determine optimal model for host use.

## [Predicting Aircraft Taxi Time](https://github.com/AbishekGollapudi/DataProjects/tree/master/Taxi-Time%20Regression)
**Using linear regression to improve runway sequencing**

Web scraped 4 months of flight statistics and weather data from 10 different airports to train a model to predict tarmac delays.
Used lasso and ridge regularization techniques in addition to polynomial transformations to optimize model performance. The main
objective of this project was to develop a tool to help air traffic controllers have a better sense of the time an aircraft needs
to takeoff.

## [AmazonHelp Chatbot](https://github.com/AbishekGollapudi/DataProjects/tree/master/AmazonHelp%20Chatbot)
**Training a chatbot to serve as a Tier 1 customer service agent**

Used a twitter corpus of conversations between the AmazonHelp twitter account and various customers to train a chatbot in PyTorch. This project involved using TorchText to tokenize and pre-process the data into batches to feed it into a seq2seq model. 


## [Web Attacks Classification](https://github.com/AbishekGollapudi/DataProjects/tree/master/Web%20Attacks%20Classification)
**Building an intrusion detection system to detect brute force attacks and SQL injections**

Used the CSE-CIC-IDS2018 dataset from the University of New Brunswick to train a classification model to detect malicious web-based attacks at a packet level. Compared performance and prediction time of various classification algorithms such as  XGBoost, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression to determine the most optimal model for use as packet sniffer.
