# Project Portfolio
______________

The following projects were developed as part of a 12-week immersive data science program, Metis. 

## [Predicting Aircraft Taxi Time](https://github.com/AbishekGollapudi/DataProjects/tree/master/Taxi-Time%20Regression)
**Using linear regression to improve runway sequencing**

Web scraped 4 months of flight statistics and weather data from 10 different airports to train a model to predict tarmac delays.
Used lasso and ridge regularization techniques in addition to polynomial transformations to optimize model performance. The main
objective of this project was to develop a tool to help air traffic controllers have a better sense of the time an aircraft needs
to takeoff.
