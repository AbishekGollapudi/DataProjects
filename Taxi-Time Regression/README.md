# Predicting Tarmac Delays

### Problem Statement
Using flight and weather data, is it possible to predict aircraft taxi times at major airports?

### Approach
1. Scrape flight data from the [Bureau of Transportation Statistics.](https://www.transtats.bts.gov/ONTIME/Departures.aspx)
2. Scrape weather data from [WeatherUnderground](https://www.wunderground.com/history/monthly/us/ca/san-francisco/KSFO/date/2019-1)
3. Clean and pre-process data
4. Modeling and Evaluation
